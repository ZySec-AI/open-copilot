## ðŸ“Œ Ground Rules

1. **Be Respectful**  
   Treat everyone with respect and professionalism. Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.

2. **Keep it Clean**  
   Make sure your contributions are well-tested, follow the coding standards, and don't break existing functionality.

3. **Use Git Properly**  
   - Keep PRs focused and minimal.
   - Write meaningful commit messages.
   - Rebase when necessary to keep a clean history.

4. **Ask First**  
   For major changes or new features, open an issue first to discuss what you'd like to change.

- PRs must pass all CI checks.
- PR titles should follow Conventional Commits:
  - `feat:` for new features

  - `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, etc.
- One feature or fix per PR â€” avoid mixing unrelated changes.
