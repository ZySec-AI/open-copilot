### Project Structure 

Here's a brief description of each folder and its purpose:

1. **integrations**: This directory likely contains code that integrates your application with external systems, APIs, or third-party services.

2. **api**: This could be a directory containing files related to the application programming interface (API) of your project, such as routes, request handlers, and API utility functions.

3. **core**: Often used for core functionality and configuration of the application. This might include essential components, shared logic, or core settings.

4. **models**: This directory is generally used to define data models, particularly when using an ORM. It contains the structure of database tables and their relationships.

5. **plugins**: The plugins directory might include additional functionalities or modules that can be optionally included in the application. These might enhance or extend the core features.

6. **services**: This directory could contain business logic or application services. It's often used for code that processes data, interacts with models, and performs the main actions of the application.

7. **utils**: Short for "utilities," this directory is typically used for utility scripts and helper functions that are used across the application. These might include generic functions like date conversion, string manipulation, etc.

8. **templates**: This directory usually contains HTML templates or other template files used for rendering dynamic information as placeholders for data that is passed from the application, allowing for dynamic content generation based on user requests or other inputs.

9. **assets**: This directory is typically used for storing static files such as images, JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, and other assets that are required by your application's front-end or files uploaded. 

### Accessing the API Documentation

- Once the application is running, navigate to `/docs` or `/redoc` on your application to view the API documentation provided by FastAPI.
